# Homework-One

For homework one, we were assigned to refactor an .html file.

## Refactor Criteria

- WHEN I view the source code;
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements;
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- WHEN I view the image elements;
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.
- WHEN I view the heading attributes;
THEN they fall in sequential order.
- WHEN I view the title element;
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
